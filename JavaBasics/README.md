# JavaBasics

This folder contains foundational Java programs to strengthen core concepts and logical thinking. It includes:

- **Basic Problems**: Covers simple programs using loops, conditionals, and functions to understand Java syntax and structure.
- **Logic-Building Problems**: Focuses on number-based logic, and beginner-friendly algorithmic challenges.

Each file is part of my practice to build confidence in Java programming and improve problem-solving skills step by step.
