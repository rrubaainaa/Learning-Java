# Learning-Java

Welcome to **Learning-Java!** This repository is a personal initiative to practice and improve my Java programming skills. It includes everything from the basics of Java syntax to more advanced data structures and algorithms (DSA). It's a space to learn by doing and grow through consistent practice.

## Project Structure

### Core Java Practice
This section includes beginner-friendly programs focused on core Java topics like:
- Data types
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Object-oriented programming basics

These programs are aimed at strengthening foundational Java concepts and logical thinking.

### Problem-Solving in Java
This part contains logic-building exercises such as:
- Pattern problems
- Number-based logic
- Small algorithmic challenges

Each program is a step toward improving problem-solving skills and code fluency.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
As I progress, I'm also focusing on essential DSA topics like:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion
- Sorting and Searching algorithms

This section will include implementations, practice problems, and my understanding of each concept.

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in core Java programming
- Develop problem-solving skills through regular practice
- Learn and implement key data structures and algorithms
- Maintain a clean, organized, and well-documented repository
- Share my journey with others learning Java and DSA
